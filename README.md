# BOOKSआलय – AI-Powered Book Discovery Platform

**🌟 Overview**

BOOKSआलय (BooksAalay) is an AI-powered book discovery and recommendation platform that helps readers find books tailored to their mood, goals, and interests.
It goes beyond traditional recommendation systems by analyzing user emotions, reading personality, and goals to deliver deeply personalized suggestions.

The platform combines AI + NLP + aesthetic UI to make book discovery feel human, emotional, and inspiring — turning reading into a journey of self-exploration.


**🎯 Problem It Solves**

Traditional book recommendation systems are limited — they rely only on ratings or genres. Readers often struggle to find books that match how they feel or what they want to achieve.

💡 BOOKSआलय solves this by offering:

•Mood-based and goal-based discovery.

•Emotionally intelligent book suggestions.

•AI conversations to understand reader context.

•Interactive, visually appealing user experience.


**🚀 Key Features**

✅ Goal-Based Discovery – Find books based on personal or professional goals (e.g., motivation, happiness, focus).
✅ Mood-Based Recommendations – Choose your mood, and AI curates books that match your emotional tone.
✅ AI Chatbot – Personalized assistant that helps you explore genres, moods, and summaries.
✅ AI Book Summarizer – Get short, smart AI-generated summaries of any book.
✅ Reading Personality Quiz – Discover your reader type through a fun AI-driven quiz.
✅ Aesthetic & Minimal UI – Clean, dark-mode-friendly interface built for an immersive reading experience.
✅ No Login Barrier – Explore and discover instantly without signup.


**🧠 How It Works**

• User Input: User selects a mood, goal, or interacts with the chatbot.

• AI Analysis: Natural Language Processing (NLP) interprets the query.

• Book Fetching: The app fetches book data via APIs (like TMDB/Google Books API).

• Dynamic Display: Books are shown with covers, titles, authors, and short AI-generated insights.

• Optional Tools: Users can take quizzes or analyze reading behavior through the “Analysis” tab.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
